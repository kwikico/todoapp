## Design System Implementation

The UI has been updated with a cohesive design system that embraces soft pastels, refined typography, and modern interaction principles. Here's an overview of the key design elements:

### Color Palette

- **Text:** Dark charcoal (#333333) for primary text and muted gray (#666666) for secondary text

### Typography

- Implemented the Open Sans font family with:
  - Light weight (300) for descriptive text
  - Regular weight (400) for body text
  - Semi-bold (600) for headings and interactive elements
- Increased line height (1.5) for improved readability
- Letter spacing adjustments for logo and headings

### Layout & Components

- Consistent spacing system using CSS variables:
  - --spacing-xs (4px)
  - --spacing-sm (8px)
